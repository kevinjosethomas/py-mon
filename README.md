As an active web developer who works with node and typescript, I decided to make something like [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) but for Python. Introducing ``py-mon``, a simple and easy-to-use python package that automatically runs your python script when it detects file changes. I've only spent a couple of hours developing this and hope to add many features in the future, from ignoring certain files to prioritizing certain extensions.
